### CHAPTER FIVE: BLOOD IN THE CATHEDRAL

**Florence, April 26, 1478**
**Sunday Morning**
**The Feast of San Marco**

The Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore could hold ten thousand souls. On this Sunday morning, Lorenzo de' Medici estimated it held perhaps three thousand—enough to bear witness, not enough to prevent violence. The mathematics of murder were simple once you understood them.

He stood in his customary place near the front, wearing dark velvet and limited jewelry. Giuliano had arrived late—he always did—and now stood beside him in crimson silk that seemed calculated to draw every eye. Lorenzo loved his brother fiercely, but sometimes that love felt like holding water: the tighter you grasped, the faster it slipped away.

"You should have stayed home," Lorenzo murmured as the priests began the processional.

"And miss this lovely Mass?" Giuliano smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "Besides, brother, someone has to look good for the family. God knows you dress like a mourner at your own funeral."

"Perhaps I am," Lorenzo said.

Around them, Florence's nobility pressed close—the Tornabuoni, the Soderini, the Strozzi. And there, across the nave, the Pazzi. Francesco de' Pazzi wore yellow silk that seemed too bright, too cheerful. His cousin Jacopo stood beside him, old and grim-faced. Archbishop Salviati was notably absent, which meant he was already moving to secure the Palazzo della Signoria.

The trap was closing.

Lorenzo felt Francesco Nori shift behind them, heard the quiet sound of steel on leather as his friend loosened a blade. Good. They would need every advantage when the violence came.

The Mass progressed with agonizing slowness. Latin phrases rolled over the congregation like waves. Lorenzo barely heard them. His attention was on the Pazzi, on the young men he didn't recognize standing too close to Giuliano, on the way Francesco kept touching something beneath his cloak.

A blade. Had to be.

Beside him, Giuliano seemed relaxed, at peace. He'd always been comfortable in churches, comfortable with God. Lorenzo had never understood it. God seemed like the universe's banker—you made deposits of prayer and good works, hoping to draw on them later. But the interest rates were terrible, and the bank could foreclose at any moment.

The priest raised the Host. 

"*Hoc est enim corpus meum,*" he intoned. This is my body.

Every head bowed.

Francesco de' Pazzi moved.

He came fast, dagger already in hand, screaming something about liberty that was lost in the sudden chaos. The blade caught Giuliano in the side, just below the ribs, and Lorenzo's brother gasped in shock more than pain.

Then Bernardo Baroncelli was there, a second conspirator, his knife rising and falling with mechanical precision. Once. Twice. Three times. Blood sprayed across the marble floor, across Lorenzo's face, across the shocked faces of worshippers who had come to pray and found themselves in hell instead.

Giuliano stumbled backward, trying to defend himself with hands that wouldn't obey. Francesco stabbed again, and again, frenzied now, every thrust a prayer of its own. Nineteen times. Later, they would count nineteen wounds. Nineteen chances for God to intervene, for Florence to wake from this nightmare.

God did not intervene.

Lorenzo moved without thinking, instinct overriding shock. His hand went to the short sword concealed beneath his cloak—concealed because he'd known, had *known* this would happen—and he drew steel even as another conspirator lunged at him.

The man's name was Antonio Maffei. A priest. A priest wearing ecclesiastical robes and carrying a blade blessed by papal authority. Lorenzo twisted aside, felt the knife scrape across his neck, hot and sharp and nearly fatal. Blood poured down his collar, but he was alive. Still alive.

Francesco Nori threw himself between Lorenzo and the conspirators, taking a blade meant for his master. The steel punched through Nori's chest and he made a sound like surprise, like disappointment. Then he fell, and Lorenzo was alone with killers in a cathedral full of screaming chaos.

"*Run!*" Poliziano appeared from somewhere, grabbing Lorenzo's arm. "The sacristy! Now!"

They ran. Behind them, Giuliano lay in a spreading pool of blood, his beautiful face turned toward the altar as if still waiting for communion. Francesco de' Pazzi stood over him, breathing hard, his yellow silk now crimson. And the people of Florence—the merchants and nobles and common folk—pressed toward the exits in a panic that threatened to crush anyone who fell.

Lorenzo burst into the sacristy with Poliziano and a handful of guards. Someone slammed the bronze doors shut and dropped the bar. Safe. For now.

"Your neck," Poliziano said urgently, pulling off his own cloak to press against the wound. "Lorenzo, your neck—"

"It's not deep," Lorenzo managed. His voice sounded strange, distant. "Where's Giuliano?"

Poliziano's expression told him everything.

"No," Lorenzo said. "No, he can't be—he was right beside me—"

"He's gone," Poliziano said quietly. "I'm sorry, Lorenzo. But he's gone."

Lorenzo felt something break inside his chest, something that had been holding him together through years of stress and scheming and sacrifice. Giuliano. His little brother. The beautiful one, the beloved one, the one who'd made life bearable through all the political maneuvering and careful calculations.

Dead.

Murdered in a cathedral.

By men who thought they could destroy the Medici.

The grief lasted three seconds. Then it transformed into something colder, harder, infinitely more dangerous. Lorenzo de' Medici had been carved from Carrara marble by enemies who'd spent years trying to destroy him. Now they'd finally succeeded in wounding him deeply enough to kill something essential.

They'd made a terrible mistake.

"How many?" he asked, his voice like winter.

"How many what?"

"Conspirators. How many are there?"

"Francesco de' Pazzi, Jacopo de' Pazzi, Archbishop Salviati, a dozen others. Maybe more." Poliziano was still pressing cloth against Lorenzo's neck, but the bleeding was slowing. "They're trying to take the palazzo, to seize control of the government. If they succeed—"

"They won't," Lorenzo interrupted. He moved to the sacristy window, looking out over Florence. Below, chaos. People running, shouting, unsure whether to flee or fight. The Medici faction gathering in confused knots. The Pazzi faction trying to rally support.

And everywhere, the question: *What happens now?*

Lorenzo knew. He'd been preparing for this moment his entire adult life. Now it was here, purchased with his brother's blood.

"Open the doors," he said.

"My lord, that's—"

"Open them. Now."

Poliziano hesitated, then nodded to the guards. The bronze doors swung wide. Lorenzo stepped out into the cathedral, blood still dripping from his neck, sword still in his hand.

The crowd fell silent. Three thousand people, watching to see what Il Magnifico would do. Whether he would flee or fight. Whether the Medici were finished.

"CITIZENS OF FLORENCE!" Lorenzo's voice cracked like a whip through the sacred space. "You have witnessed murder. Treachery. An attack on your rightful leaders by men who claim to act for your freedom. But ask yourselves: what freedom comes from knives in a cathedral? What liberty requires the blood of innocents?"

He gestured toward Giuliano's body, still lying where he'd fallen. Someone had covered it with a cloak, but blood seeped through the fabric.

"My brother is dead. Francesco Nori, loyal friend, is dead. Murdered by the Pazzi family and their conspirators. Murdered with the blessing of Archbishop Salviati and the tacit approval of Rome. They thought that by killing us, they would free you. But they only enslaved themselves—to ambition, to greed, to the delusion that power can be seized through violence."

More people were gathering now, spilling in from the piazzas, from the streets. The Medici name was being shouted. And—distantly—the sound of fighting. The Palazzo della Signoria. Archbishop Salviati making his move.

"I am wounded but alive," Lorenzo continued. "And as long as I live, Florence lives. The Medici Bank will continue to operate. Our alliances will hold. Our commitments will be honored. But the Pazzi..." His voice dropped to something lethal. "The Pazzi will pay for what they've done here today. Every conspirator. Every supporter. Every man who thought he could murder his way to power. They will learn that in Florence, there is one law: you do not strike at the Medici and survive."

The crowd erupted. Not in dissent, but in roaring approval. These were Lorenzo's people—the bankers and merchants and artisans whose prosperity depended on Medici stability. They didn't care about republican ideals or papal politics. They cared about trade routes and interest rates and knowing that tomorrow would be like yesterday.

The Pazzi had offered them chaos. Lorenzo was offering them continuity.

They chose continuity.

"FIND THEM!" someone shouted. "Find the Pazzi!"

The cry was taken up by hundreds of voices. "THE PAZZI! DEATH TO THE PAZZI!"

Lorenzo watched the mob form with grim satisfaction. He'd directed it, shaped it, given it purpose. Now it would become his weapon, his instrument of vengeance. The people of Florence would hunt down the conspirators and deliver them to justice—or something that looked enough like justice to satisfy the angry need for retribution.

"My lord," Poliziano said quietly. "The palazzo. Salviati—"

"Is about to fail," Lorenzo finished. "Come. We have work to do."

---

At the Palazzo della Signoria, Archbishop Francesco Salviati was learning the difference between planning a conspiracy and executing one. His soldiers had seized the lower floors easily enough—guards caught by surprise, doors battered open, the mechanics of a coup proceeding according to schedule. But now they were trapped.

The Gonfaloniere, the chief magistrate of Florence, had barricaded himself in the upper chambers and was calling for help. And Florence was answering.

Salviati heard the roar from outside, heard the mob approaching. They were chanting something. It took him a moment to make out the words.

"*Palle! Palle!*"

The Medici battle cry. The red balls of their coat of arms, transformed into a shout of defiance. *Palle*. Balls. A crude symbol for a crude reality: the Medici had them, and the Pazzi did not.

"We need to retreat," one of his captains said urgently. "My lord, if we're trapped here—"

"We're already trapped," Salviati replied. He looked down at his archbishop's robes, expensive silk now stained with sweat and fear. He'd thought this would be easy. Kill the Medici brothers, seize the government, claim the city in the name of liberty. Simple.

He'd been a fool.

The mob broke through the outer doors. Salviati heard them coming up the stairs, hundreds of feet, thousands of voices. The sound of Florence's rage made physical, given teeth and hands and the absolute certainty of righteous violence.

"In the name of God," Salviati said, but his voice shook. "In the name of His Holiness Pope Sixtus—"

The mob didn't care about popes. They cared about stability, prosperity, the familiar order that the Medici represented. And they cared about punishing traitors.

They took Salviati and his conspirators in the upper halls. There was no trial, no formal process. Florence's justice in that moment was swift and absolute. They hanged the Archbishop from the palazzo windows, still in his robes, still clutching prayers that God would not hear.

Seventy feet below, the piazza filled with Florentines who watched and cheered as the conspirators dropped one by one, their necks breaking with cracks that sounded like branches snapping.

Jacopo de' Pazzi tried to flee the city. He was old, seventy-six, and had been reluctant to join the conspiracy from the start. But family loyalty had overcome wisdom, and now he rode through the Porta San Gallo with murder on his conscience and terror in his heart.

They caught him twenty miles from Florence. Peasants, mainly, who'd heard about the attempted coup and saw an opportunity for reward. They dragged him back to the city, where Lorenzo's guards were waiting.

Francesco de' Pazzi was found in his palazzo, trying to hide in a wine cellar. They pulled him out, screaming about justice and liberty, words that meant nothing now that his conspiracy had failed. His yellow silk was still stained with Giuliano's blood—evidence enough for any tribunal.

But there was no tribunal. Florence in its fury had no patience for legal niceties. They hanged Francesco from the Bargello, alongside his cousin and his co-conspirators. Dozens of men, strung up like game, their bodies swaying in the spring breeze.

And still the purge continued.

Anyone connected to the Pazzi, however tangentially. Anyone who'd spoken against the Medici. Anyone suspected of supporting the conspiracy, or knowing about it, or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. The mob had tasted blood and wanted more.

Lorenzo, watching from the Palazzo Medici, felt nothing. Not satisfaction, not horror, not relief. Just the cold calculation of a man who understood that cruelty could be useful, that terror had its place in statecraft.

The Pazzi had tried to kill him. They had killed Giuliano, killed Francesco Nori, nearly killed Lorenzo himself. Now they were learning the price of failure.

"Eighty-three so far," Poliziano reported, consulting a list. "Hanged, thrown from the palazzo, torn apart by mobs. And more arrests being made every hour."

"Good," Lorenzo said. His neck was bandaged, his clothes changed, but he could still feel Giuliano's blood on his skin. Could still see his brother's shocked expression as the knives went in. "Let the purge continue. I want every conspirator found. Every supporter punished. Every man who even thought about betraying Florence made to regret it."

"Some of the families are powerful, Lorenzo. Influential. Killing them all will create enemies."

"Letting them live will create more," Lorenzo replied. "No, Angelo. This ends now. Today. Completely. The Pazzi family is finished. Their bank is forfeit. Their properties seized. Their name stricken from Florence's rolls. And every other family in Italy is going to understand what happens when you try to murder a Medici."

He turned from the window, moving to his desk where letters waited. Letters to Milan, to Venice, to Naples. Letters explaining what had happened, spinning the narrative before the Pazzi could control it. Positioning Florence as the victim, Lorenzo as the survivor, the conspiracy as an unprovoked attack.

Politics never stopped. Not even when you were drowning in grief.

"What about Rome?" Poliziano asked quietly. "Pope Sixtus backed this conspiracy. He's complicit in Giuliano's murder."

"Rome," Lorenzo said, "is next. But first, we secure Florence. Then we deal with His Holiness."

Outside, the bells of the city rang in wild celebration. Florence had survived. The Medici had survived. And eighty-three corpses swung from palazzo windows, a message written in flesh and hemp: *Do not strike at the Medici and expect to live.*

Lorenzo de' Medici stood at his desk, writing letters by candlelight, his brother's blood still metaphorically on his hands. He'd won. At terrible cost, but he'd won.

The conspiracy was crushed.

But the war was just beginning.
