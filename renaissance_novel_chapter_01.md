### CHAPTER ONE: THE TYRANT'S MASS

**Milan, December 26, 1476**
**The Feast of Santo Stefano**

The smell of incense could not quite mask the stink of corruption in the Cathedral of Santo Stefano. Ludovico Sforza stood in the shadows of the north transept, watching his brother kneel before God and thought about murder.

Not his own, of course. Ludovico was not the murdering kind—at least not directly. He preferred to let others bloody their hands while he shaped the consequences. But as he watched Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza bow his head in prayer, resplendent in cloth-of-gold and crimson velvet, surrounded by fifty guards whose loyalty had been purchased with Milanese silver, Ludovico knew that death walked these marble halls.

He had heard the whispers. A younger son learned to listen in the spaces between words, to read the language of sidelong glances and pregnant silences. Three men in the crowd wore daggers beneath their cloaks. Three men whose faces held the hollowed-out expression of those who had already crossed the Rubicon in their hearts.

The Duke's voice rose in devotional song, clear and beautiful. Galeazzo had many gifts—he could sing like an angel while ordering men flayed alive. He could compose poetry that made women weep, then rape their daughters for sport. Their father, Francesco Sforza, had been a condottiero who seized Milan with courage and cunning. Galeazzo had inherited the throne but none of the virtue.

"You see them too," came a whisper at Ludovico's elbow.

He did not start. He had learned to control such reactions long ago. Turning his head slightly, he found Cicco Simonetta standing beside him, the Duke's chief minister, a man whose mind worked like a clockwork mechanism—precise, inexorable, and utterly without mercy when necessity demanded.

"I see many things, Cicco," Ludovico murmured. "The question is always which things matter."

"The one in the brown cloak," Simonetta said softly. "Giovanni Andrea Lampugnani. Minor noble, claims the Duke stole his property. The tall one is Carlo Visconti. And the young one who cannot stop trembling—that is Girolamo Olgiati. A student, filled with Plutarch and Roman dreams of tyrannicide."

"You know their names," Ludovico said. "Why do they still breathe?"

"Because I would know who put them up to this. A murder without patrons is merely a crime. A murder with patrons is an opportunity."

Before Ludovico could respond, the liturgy ended. Galeazzo rose, genuflected with elaborate ceremony, and turned to process down the nave. The crowd pressed close—nobles, merchants, common folk, all come to worship and to be seen worshipping. The Duke's guards moved to clear space, but there were too many bodies, too much chaos in the sacred crush.

Lampugnani moved first.

He burst from the crowd with a blade already in his hand, screaming something about justice that was lost in the sudden roar of panic. The dagger caught Galeazzo in the side, just below the ribs, and the Duke's beautiful voice rose in a shriek of pain and outrage.

Then all three conspirators were on him, hacking and stabbing with the desperate fury of men who knew they would not leave this place alive. Carlo Visconti drove a blade into Galeazzo's chest. Olgiati, the student, wept as he struck again and again, blood spraying across the marble floor, across the hem of his own cloak, across the face of a woman who had fainted into the spreading pool of crimson.

The guards were too slow, too surprised, too hampered by the screaming mob. By the time they reached the Duke, Galeazzo Maria Sforza lay in a spreading lake of his own blood, his mouth opening and closing like a fish pulled from water, his eyes finding Ludovico's across the chaos.

Those eyes held a question. Or perhaps an accusation.

Then they held nothing at all.

Ludovico watched the light fade from his brother's gaze with something that was not quite satisfaction and not quite grief. It was simpler than that—it was calculation. The Duke was dead. Long live the Duke.

But which Duke?

Galeazzo had a son, young Gian Galeazzo, barely seven years old. A child Duke meant a regency. A regency meant opportunity.

The guards cut down Lampugnani where he stood, hacking him to pieces even as he tried to flee. Visconti managed three steps before a halberd took him in the back. Only Olgiati escaped into the panicked crowd, though Ludovico knew he would not get far. The student's hands had been shaking too badly. He lacked the constitution for murder.

"My lord," Simonetta said quietly. "We must secure the castello. The Duchess will be—"

"The Duchess will be distraught," Ludovico interrupted. "As will young Gian Galeazzo. They will need protection. Guidance." He turned to look at Simonetta fully now. "They will need family."

The minister's eyes were dark and knowing. "And family must always come first."

"Always," Ludovico agreed.

---

By nightfall, Milan was a powder keg wrapped in silk. The city had loved Francesco Sforza, who had given them stability after decades of chaos. They had tolerated Galeazzo, who had given them spectacle and terror in equal measure. But they did not yet know what to make of the news that spread like plague through the narrow streets: the Duke was dead, murdered in God's own house by men who claimed to act for liberty.

Liberty. Ludovico almost laughed at the word as he climbed the narrow stair to his chambers in the Castello Sforzesco. The fortress loomed over Milan like a fist of stone, its walls thick enough to withstand artillery, its towers high enough to see an army coming from leagues away. Francesco had built it to project power. Galeazzo had filled it with gold and art and the screams of his victims. Now it would be young Gian Galeazzo's cage, and Ludovico would hold the key.

His rooms were sparse compared to the ducal apartments—he had always preferred function to display. A desk covered in correspondence, maps of Italy rolled and stacked in a corner, a single shelf of books that he actually read rather than collected for show. He poured himself wine from a Venetian glass carafe, noting that his hand was steady. Good. He would need steadiness in the days ahead.

A knock at the door, soft but insistent.

"Enter."

The woman who stepped through was not beautiful in the conventional sense. Caterina was tall for a woman, with her father Galeazzo's sharp features and none of his cruelty. At thirteen, she already moved with a predator's grace, and her eyes held a calculation that reminded Ludovico uncomfortably of his own.

"Uncle," she said, closing the door behind her. "They're saying you knew. That you could have stopped it."

"They say many things," Ludovico replied. "Most of them foolish."

"Did you?" She crossed to stand before him, this illegitimate daughter of a tyrant, this girl who had learned early that the only person she could trust was herself. "Know, I mean. Could you have saved him?"

The question hung between them like smoke. Ludovico could lie—he was skilled at it—but he sensed that this was one of those moments where the truth might serve him better. Caterina had no power now, but she would. He had seen enough to know that she was dangerous in ways that most men would never recognize until too late.

"I knew something would happen," he said carefully. "I did not know when, or precisely how. And I did not stop it because..." He paused, choosing his words. "Because sometimes, niece, the only way forward is through fire. Your father was burning Milan. He would have reduced it all to ash eventually."

"So you let him die."

"I let events take their course. There is a difference."

She studied him for a long moment, and he could see her mind working, cataloging, filing away this information for future use. Finally, she nodded. "What happens now?"

"Now? Now we mourn publicly and maneuver privately. Young Gian Galeazzo becomes Duke, with his mother as regent. I become his guardian and protector. And we ensure that no one—not Venice, not Florence, not Rome—sees this moment of weakness as an opportunity."

"And Duchess Bona?" Caterina asked. "She won't simply hand you the keys to the castello."

"No," Ludovico agreed. "She won't. But Bona of Savoy is a foreigner in Milan, a woman who never learned Italian properly, who never understood that power here is not given by title but seized by will. She will fight for her son's rights. And she will lose."

"You sound very certain."

"I am certain of very few things in this life, niece. But I am certain of this: I will not let Milan fall into chaos. Whatever else I may be, I am a Sforza. This city, this duchy, this is ours. And I will hold it against all who would take it from us." He drained his wine and set the glass down with careful precision. "The question is whether you will help me, or whether you will be another problem I must solve."

Caterina smiled then, and it was not a pleasant expression. "I am my father's daughter, Uncle. I know how to survive. And I know that right now, you are the most dangerous man in Milan—which means you're the safest ally I could have."

"Wise girl."

"Wise woman," she corrected. "In a few years, I'll be married off to some lord or condottiero, and then I'll have my own game to play. Until then..." She shrugged. "Until then, I watch and learn."

"Good," Ludovico said. "Then watch this: tomorrow we will hold a council. The surviving nobles, the church, the Milanese patricians—all the vultures who think they can carve up what remains. And we will show them that the Sforza still have teeth."

"And Olgiati? The one who escaped?"

"They caught him an hour ago. He's in the cells beneath the castello. He'll be questioned, tortured, and executed as an example. But before that, I want to speak with him myself."

"Why?"

"Because he's young and educated and full of republican ideals. Because he's the kind of fool who thinks murder can change the world. Because..." Ludovico moved to the window, looking out over the dark sprawl of Milan, the city that had been his prison and would now be his kingdom. "Because I want to understand what drives a man to throw away his life for an idea. Knowledge is power, Caterina. Never forget that. The more you know about your enemies—about why they do what they do—the more easily you can destroy them."

She came to stand beside him, following his gaze out over the city. Somewhere out there, men were celebrating a tyrant's death. Somewhere else, men were plotting how to take advantage of the chaos. And in a hundred rooms across Milan, women were barring their doors and hiding their daughters, knowing that when power changed hands, it was always the innocent who paid the price first.

"Will you be a better Duke than he was?" Caterina asked quietly.

"I won't be Duke at all," Ludovico replied. "I'll be something more useful—the power behind the throne. Let Gian Galeazzo have the title and the crown. Let him suffer through the ceremonies and the diplomatic dinners. I'll take the reality of rule and leave him the appearance."

"And if he grows old enough to want the reality for himself?"

Ludovico turned to look at his niece, this fierce girl who understood the game better than most men twice her age. "Then we'll have that conversation when the time comes. But for now, we have more immediate concerns. Venice is watching. Florence is watching. Rome is watching. They all want to know if Milan will fracture, if this moment of weakness will become a permanent condition. And we must show them that it will not."

"How?"

"By being indispensable. By being the steady hand that keeps the duchy running. By being so thoroughly in control that no one can imagine Milan without us." He smiled thinly. "Your father ruled through fear. I will rule through necessity. And in the end, necessity is far stronger than fear, because people can learn to overcome fear. But they never learn to live without the things they need."

A bell tolled in the distance, marking the hour. Midnight. The day of Santo Stefano was over, and Galeazzo Maria Sforza was still dead. Milan slept uneasily, dreaming troubled dreams of what would come next.

Ludovico turned from the window and began planning for the morning. There would be councils to convene, letters to write, alliances to forge. He would need to send word to Florence, to Lorenzo de' Medici, that old banking partner of his father's. The Medici and the Sforza had always found common cause against Venice and Rome. That alliance would be crucial now.

And he would need to consolidate his position within Milan itself. Duchess Bona had allies among the nobility, men who would prefer a regency they could control to Ludovico's firm hand. Cicco Simonetta was useful, but ultimately the minister served Milan's interests, not necessarily Ludovico's. He would need to be managed carefully.

"Get some rest, niece," he said. "Tomorrow begins a new age for Milan. We should be clear-eyed when we seize it."

Caterina nodded and moved to the door, but paused with her hand on the latch. "Uncle? Do you ever wonder if we're damned? For the things we do, the things we plan to do?"

Ludovico considered the question. "Every day," he admitted. "But damnation is a price I'm willing to pay for power. Because without power, we have nothing. Without power, we're simply victims of other men's ambitions. And I would rather burn in Hell as a master than beg in Heaven as a slave."

"I thought you might say something like that," she said, and there was something almost like approval in her voice. Then she was gone, leaving Ludovico alone with his wine and his maps and his plans.

He returned to his desk and began to write. Letters to allies, instructions to agents, orders to be carried out with precision and speed. Outside, Milan slept. Inside, Ludovico Sforza began to build an empire from the ashes of his brother's murder.

The game had changed. A new player sat at the table.

And he intended to win.
