### CHAPTER FOUR: THE CONSPIRACY

**Rome, April 1478**
**Ten Days Before the Storm**

Francesco de' Pazzi hated waiting. He was a man of action, decisive and bold, qualities that had made him successful in banking but dangerous in politics. Now, standing in a private chamber of the Vatican Palace, watching Pope Sixtus IV pretend to pray, Francesco felt impatience gnawing at his gut like a rat.

"Your Holiness," he said finally. "We need a decision."

The Pope rose from his knees with a grunt of effort. Sixtus IV was sixty-four years old, corpulent, and afflicted with gout that made him irritable on good days and vicious on bad ones. Today seemed to be trending toward bad.

"You need a decision," Sixtus repeated. "You, Francesco de' Pazzi, banker and conspirator, tell the Vicar of Christ what he needs." The Pope limped to a chair, lowering himself carefully. "Perhaps I should tell you what I need. I need the Medici Bank removed from papal finances. I need Florence to stop opposing every appointment I make. I need Girolamo to have territories he can rule properly."

Girolamo Riario stood by the window, the Pope's nephew and the true architect of this conspiracy. He was thirty-three, handsome in a sharp way, and possessed of ambitions that made Francesco's look modest by comparison.

"Uncle," Riario said smoothly, "Francesco is right that we need to commit. The pieces are in position. The date is set. But if Your Holiness is having doubts—"

"I'm not having doubts about removing the Medici," Sixtus interrupted. "I'm having doubts about murder. There's a difference."

"Then we'll make it look like something else," Francesco said quickly. "A popular uprising. Florentine patriots acting to free their city from Medici tyranny. Archbishop Salviati will legitimize it by seizing the Palazzo della Signoria in the name of proper government. By the time anyone questions it, the deed will be done and Florence will be ours."

"Florence will never be yours," Sixtus said flatly. "Florence is a republic. It belongs to its citizens."

"Its citizens will do what they're told," Riario said, "once the Medici are gone and the alternative is chaos." He turned from the window, his face set in determined lines. "Your Holiness, we've spent months planning this. We have men in Florence ready to act. We have Montesecco and his soldiers. We have the Archbishop's support. We have the Pazzi family's resources. Everything is ready."

"Except the Pope's blessing," Francesco added. "Which we need. Your Holiness, the Medici have opposed you at every turn. They've blocked your policies, defied your appointments, turned Florence into a thorn in your side. Lorenzo de' Medici acts like he's your equal, like banking wealth gives him the right to treat with the Vicar of Christ as a partner rather than a subject."

He saw the anger flare in Sixtus's eyes and pressed his advantage. "He must be taught humility. And Florence must learn that opposing Rome has consequences."

"Fine," Sixtus said abruptly. "Do what you must. But I will not condone murder explicitly. I want the Medici removed from power, their bank replaced, their influence in Florence broken. How you achieve that is your affair. But when you come before God to account for your actions, don't expect me to share your punishment."

It was as much approval as they would get. Francesco bowed. "Your Holiness is wise and merciful."

"I'm old and tired," Sixtus corrected. "And I'm trusting you not to make me regret this. Now go. I have prayers to say, and you have whatever it is conspirators do when they're not conspiring."

Outside the chamber, walking through corridors decorated with frescoes paid for by Medici gold, Francesco felt a surge of triumph. They had the Pope's tacit approval. The last obstacle had fallen.

"He's going to deny everything afterward," Riario said quietly. "You know that, yes? If we fail, Sixtus will claim he knew nothing about any assassination plot."

"We won't fail," Francesco replied. "Lorenzo and Giuliano will be together at High Mass on Sunday. In the cathedral, surrounded by worshippers, with their guards left outside per custom. It's perfect."

"Montesecco is having doubts."

Francesco stopped walking. "What?"

"The condottiero. He's uncomfortable with killing men during Mass. Something about sacred ground and eternal damnation." Riario's tone was mocking. "These mercenaries. They'll kill for money anywhere else, but add some incense and holy water and suddenly they develop scruples."

"Can we replace him?"

"With ten days to prepare? No. But we can work around him. Use him to secure the palazzo, let others handle the actual killing." Riario resumed walking. "I've been thinking about the violence itself. It needs to be fast, decisive, overwhelming. No hesitation, no mercy. The Medici are dangerous. If we wound them without killing them, they'll destroy us."

"I know how to use a knife," Francesco said coldly.

"Yes, but do you know how to use it in a cathedral full of witnesses? This isn't a dark alley, Francesco. This is theater as much as murder. We need to make it look like justice, like liberation. The people of Florence need to see the Medici as tyrants being struck down, not as innocent victims being assassinated."

They emerged into a courtyard where spring sunshine turned the Vatican's stone into gold. Roman gold, eternal and imperial. Francesco breathed it in, feeling his destiny crystallizing.

"Sunday," he said. "High Mass at Santa Maria del Fiore. The elevation of the Host will be our signal. When the priest raises the bread and wine, when every head is bowed in reverence, we strike. Both brothers, simultaneously. Quick and clean. Then Salviati takes the palazzo, we secure the city, and by nightfall Florence has new leadership."

"And if something goes wrong?"

"Then we improvise," Francesco said. "But nothing will go wrong. The Pazzi have been planning this for months. Every detail has been considered, every contingency planned for. This is our moment, Girolamo. Our chance to replace the Medici, to make our families the true powers in Florence. To show all of Italy that banking dynasties can be toppled as easily as any throne."

Riario smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. "Just make sure you kill them both. Lorenzo especially. He's the dangerous one, the politician. Giuliano is just a pretty face. But Lorenzo..." He shook his head. "Lorenzo is the kind of man who'll survive a dozen knife wounds and still find a way to take revenge. Make absolutely certain he dies, Francesco. Or we'll be the ones who do."

They parted in the courtyard, each returning to their own schemes. Francesco walked through Rome with his head high, already imagining his triumphant return to Florence. The Pazzi Bank would replace the Medici Bank. The Pazzi family would claim its rightful place among Florence's nobility. And Francesco himself would be remembered as the man who liberated the city from tyranny.

He could almost taste it.

**Florence, April 24, 1478**
**Two Days Before the Storm**

Angelo Poliziano found Lorenzo in his study, surrounded by books he wasn't reading and wine he wasn't drinking. The poet-philosopher had known Lorenzo long enough to recognize this mood—the stillness before violence, the calm of a man who had done everything he could and now waited for fate to unfold.

"I brought you something," Poliziano said, closing the door behind him. He held up a letter. "From your agent in Rome. Arrived an hour ago."

Lorenzo took it, broke the seal, read quickly. His expression didn't change, but Poliziano saw his hand tighten on the parchment.

"Well?" Poliziano asked.

"Sunday," Lorenzo said quietly. "High Mass at the Duomo. Francesco de' Pazzi has returned from Rome with men and money. Archbishop Salviati is positioning soldiers near the Palazzo della Signoria. The conspiracy is moving."

"Then we stop it. We arrest Francesco, we confront Salviati, we—"

"We have no proof," Lorenzo interrupted. "Nothing that would stand up in front of the Signoria. Nothing that wouldn't make us look like paranoid tyrants attacking noble families without cause." He set down the letter. "And even if we had proof, it's too late. They're committed now. If we don't stop them Sunday, they'll just try again Monday or Tuesday or next month. The only way to end this is to let them make their move and crush them in the attempt."

"You're using yourself as bait."

"I'm using the truth as a weapon," Lorenzo corrected. "Let them attack us during High Mass, in front of hundreds of witnesses. Let them show Florence what they really are—murderers and traitors dressed up as liberators. Then we respond with righteous fury, and no one will question our right to destroy them utterly."

Poliziano moved to the window, looking out over Florence. The city was beautiful in the late afternoon light, all red tiles and stone towers, the Duomo's dome rising above everything like a benediction. It was worth fighting for. Worth dying for, if necessary.

"Where's Giuliano?" he asked.

"At his villa. I've sent word for him to stay there, to claim illness on Sunday and miss Mass."

"Will he listen?"

"No," Lorenzo said with a faint smile. "He's too proud, too defiant. He'll come to Mass specifically because I told him not to. He'll want to show the Pazzi that we're not afraid."

"Then he'll die."

"Possibly. Probably." Lorenzo's voice went flat. "But I can't protect him from himself, Angelo. I've tried. God knows I've tried. But Giuliano sees everything as poetry and grand gestures. He doesn't understand that sometimes survival requires cowardice."

"You're not a coward."

"I'm a pragmatist. There's a difference." Lorenzo rose from his desk, moving to stand beside Poliziano at the window. "I love my brother. But I love Florence more. And if Giuliano's death is the price for preserving what we've built here—for keeping the city stable, for protecting our family's legacy—then that's a price I'm prepared to pay."

"Even if it destroys you?"

"I'm already destroyed," Lorenzo said softly. "I've been destroyed since the moment I understood what power really costs. Since I realized that being Il Magnifico means sacrificing the man I might have been for the symbol I need to be." He turned to face Poliziano fully. "Promise me something, Angelo."

"Anything."

"If I die Sunday, if both Giuliano and I fall to the Pazzi blades, promise you'll protect my family. Get my wife and children out of Florence, to safety. And then make sure the Pazzi pay. Hunt them down, every last one. Make them regret the day they thought they could destroy the Medici."

Poliziano felt tears prick his eyes. "You're not going to die."

"Probably not," Lorenzo agreed. "I'm hard to kill—ask anyone who's tried. But if I do, if the universe has decided that my time is up, then I need to know that someone I trust will finish what I started."

"You have my word."

"Good." Lorenzo managed a genuine smile. "Now let's talk about practical matters. Francesco Nori will be with us at Mass. He's loyal, capable with a blade if necessary. Luigi Pulci is bringing some of our household guards—they'll stay outside, but close enough to help if we call. And I've arranged for certain sympathetic families to be in the cathedral, positioned where they can move quickly if violence erupts."

"You've thought of everything."

"I've tried. But conspiracy is like water—it finds ways through cracks you never knew existed. All we can do is be ready to improvise, to react faster than our enemies can adapt. And to make absolutely certain that when the violence starts, we're the ones left standing when it ends."

They planned through the night, two friends sitting in a study while Florence slept, imagining scenarios of murder and survival. What if Francesco attacked from the right? What if there were more conspirators than they knew about? What if the guards were compromised? What if the Signoria turned against them?

Question after question, contingency after contingency. Lorenzo answered them all with the same methodical focus he brought to banking. Violence was just another form of transaction, after all. Someone paid in blood, and someone else collected the profit.

Near dawn, Poliziano finally left. Lorenzo remained at his desk, watching the sun rise over Florence, knowing that this might be one of his last sunrises. Knowing that in less than forty-eight hours, he would either be alive and victorious or dead and vindicated.

Either way, the Pazzi would learn what it meant to strike at the Medici.

**Saturday, April 25, 1478**

Giuliano de' Medici woke with a woman he didn't love in a bed he barely remembered. This was not unusual. What was unusual was the sick feeling in his gut, the sense that something terrible was approaching like a summer storm.

He dressed quietly, leaving the woman sleeping, and walked through Florence's morning streets. Market vendors were setting up, calling out their wares—fresh bread, spring vegetables, wine from Chianti. Life going on as always, beautiful and banal and utterly unaware that tomorrow might change everything.

Giuliano found himself at the Duomo, standing before the great cathedral where tomorrow's Mass would be held. The facade was still unfinished—they'd been working on it for decades, might work on it for decades more. That was Florence: always building, always perfecting, never quite satisfied with what they had.

"You shouldn't be here."

He turned to find Francesco Nori approaching, his friend's face creased with worry.

"Where should I be?" Giuliano asked.

"Anywhere but here. Lorenzo told me about the warning. The Pazzi are going to move tomorrow. During Mass. You need to stay away, claim illness, let Lorenzo handle—"

"Let Lorenzo handle everything?" Giuliano interrupted. "Like always? While I hide and play the beautiful fool?"

"You're not a fool," Nori said quietly. "But you are proud. And pride gets men killed."

"So does cowardice."

"There's no cowardice in survival, Giuliano. There's only wisdom." Nori moved closer, lowering his voice. "Listen to me. Francesco de' Pazzi has murder in his eyes. I've seen men look that way before—they're beyond reason, beyond fear. They've convinced themselves that killing you and Lorenzo is somehow noble, somehow necessary. And men who think murder is noble are the most dangerous kind."

"Then let them come," Giuliano said. "Let them try. I won't hide from cowards with knives."

"This isn't about bravery!" Nori's voice rose, then fell again as people looked their way. "This is about not giving them what they want. They need both of you dead, Giuliano. If only Lorenzo survives, the Medici survive. The conspiracy fails. But if you insist on attending Mass tomorrow, if you give them the opportunity to kill both brothers at once..." He shook his head. "Then they win. And Florence loses."

Giuliano looked up at the Duomo's unfinished facade, thinking about beauty and incompletion. Thinking about legacy and pride and all the things men died for when they should have lived for them instead.

"I'll think about it," he said finally.

"Don't think," Nori urged. "Act. For Lorenzo. For your family. For Florence."

But Giuliano was already walking away, back toward his villa, his mind made up in ways he couldn't quite articulate. He would go to Mass tomorrow. He would stand beside Lorenzo. And if the Pazzi wanted to kill them, they would have to do it in front of God and Florence and history itself.

Some things were worth dying for.

Even if you couldn't quite explain why.
