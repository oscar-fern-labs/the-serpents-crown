### CHAPTER NINE: THE GOLDEN AGE AND THE SERPENT'S EGG

**Milan, June 1490**

Leonardo da Vinci stood before a wall in the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie and contemplated the impossible. Duke Ludovico—everyone called him Duke now, though technically he remained regent—had commissioned a fresco of the Last Supper. Not unusual. Every church in Italy had such scenes. But Ludovico wanted something different. Something that captured the moment Christ announced betrayal, the psychological drama of that instant when faith confronted treachery.

Leonardo loved impossible tasks. They were the only ones worth attempting.

"How progresses the masterpiece?" Ludovico asked, entering the refectory with Beatrice at his side. They made a striking pair—he in black velvet that accentuated his sharp intelligence, she in crimson silk that complemented her dark beauty. Twelve years of marriage had refined their partnership into something rare: genuine affection mixed with political acumen.

"Slowly," Leonardo admitted. "I'm experimenting with new techniques. Oil and tempera rather than true fresco. It will allow more detail, more subtle expression. But it's difficult, unpredictable."

"Like everything worth doing," Beatrice said, moving closer to study the preliminary sketches. "I see what you're attempting. Each apostle with different reactions—shock, anger, denial, grief. The psychology of betrayal made visible."

"Exactly, Your Grace. Anyone can paint religious scenes. I want to paint human truth."

Ludovico smiled. This was why he'd brought Leonardo to Milan, why he paid him lavishly despite the artist's tendency to leave projects unfinished. Because genius deserved patronage, and patronage defined civilization. Milan under his rule had become a magnet for the greatest minds in Italy—Leonardo, Bramante the architect, poets and scholars and engineers. The city that had been merely powerful was becoming culturally dominant.

"Take your time," Ludovico said. "Perfection can't be rushed. Unlike politics, which tolerates nothing but speed."

They left Leonardo to his sketches and walked through Milan's streets. The city had transformed during Ludovico's regency. New buildings, renovated fortifications, improved waterworks. The castello that Francesco Sforza built and Galeazzo had filled with horror now housed libraries, art collections, musical performances. Power displayed through culture rather than terror.

"You've done well," Beatrice said quietly. "Milan is magnificent."

"Milan is prosperous," Ludovico corrected. "There's a difference. Magnificence is what Lorenzo has in Florence—that combination of power and beauty that makes the city itself into art. We're getting there, but we're not there yet."

"Because you're not Duke. Not really."

He sighed. They'd had this conversation before, in various forms, over years. Gian Galeazzo Sforza was twenty-one now, married to Isabella of Aragon, and increasingly resentful of being Duke in name only. The boy—man, now—wanted real power. Wanted to rule Milan himself. Wanted his uncle to step aside or at least share authority.

"He's not ready," Ludovico said. "He's impulsive, easily influenced, more interested in hunting than governance. If I handed him real power, he'd destroy everything we've built within a year."

"And if you don't? If you keep him locked in ceremonial irrelevance?" Beatrice's tone was gentle but pointed. "He'll hate you. His wife already does—Isabella writes constantly to her father in Naples, complaining about how the Sforza Duke is treated like a prisoner in his own castello."

"Then let him hate me. I'd rather be hated and effective than loved and watch Milan collapse." But Ludovico's voice lacked conviction. He knew the situation was untenable. You couldn't rule through a puppet indefinitely. Eventually, the puppet either became real or broke.

They returned to the castello to find crisis waiting. Cicco Simonetta sat in Ludovico's private chambers, his expression grave.

"France," he said without preamble. "We have reports from our agents in Lyon. King Charles VIII is preparing for an Italian campaign. He claims Milan as his inheritance—says the Visconti line should have passed to Orleans rather than Sforza. And he's building an army."

Ludovico felt ice in his stomach. France. The sleeping giant to the north. The vast kingdom whose population dwarfed Italy's, whose armies had crushed England in the Hundred Years War, whose king dreamed of empire.

"When?" he asked.

"Not this year. Possibly next. He's young, inexperienced, still consolidating his own position. But his advisors are pushing for Italian intervention. They see the peninsula as fragmented, weak, ripe for conquest."

"And they're right," Ludovico said bitterly. "Venice and Milan just finished bleeding each other in the Ferrara War. Naples is unstable. Florence is aging with Lorenzo. Rome is mired in Borgia corruption. We're a collection of rich, weak states just waiting to be plucked."

"So what do we do?" Beatrice asked.

"We survive. We adapt. We make ourselves too useful to destroy and too dangerous to attack." Ludovico moved to his desk, began composing letters in his mind. "Contact Naples. Contact Florence. Contact Venice, despite our recent war. Everyone needs to understand that a French invasion threatens us all. If Charles comes south, we need a united Italian response."

"You want to unite Italy?" Simonetta sounded skeptical. "The same Italian states that have been fighting each other for centuries?"

"I want them scared enough to cooperate. At least temporarily." Ludovico looked at his minister. "And Cicco? Find out everything about Charles VIII. His personality, his advisors, his weaknesses. Because if he does invade, I need to know how to manipulate him."

After Simonetta departed, Beatrice moved to stand behind Ludovico, her hands on his shoulders. "You're playing a dangerous game."

"I've been playing dangerous games since I was twenty. This is just another one."

"No," she said quietly. "This is different. You're not maneuvering between Italian powers anymore. You're inviting a foreign kingdom into the peninsula. If France comes, if you use them to threaten your rivals, you won't be able to control what happens next."

"I'm not inviting them," Ludovico protested. "I'm preparing for their inevitable arrival. Charles VIII is coming whether I want him to or not. My job is to make sure Milan survives when he does."

"By making deals with devils."

"By doing what's necessary."

They stared at each other, husband and wife, partners in power, suddenly on opposite sides of a fundamental question. Beatrice broke first, turning away.

"Just be careful," she said. "You're brilliant, Ludovico. But brilliance has limits. And France has none."

**Florence, April 1492**

Lorenzo de' Medici was dying. He knew it with the certainty that came from months of increasing pain, declining strength, the slow shutdown of a body that had carried him through forty-three years of ambition and violence and triumph. His doctors spoke in euphemisms, but Lorenzo had always preferred truth.

He'd summoned the family to the Medici villa at Careggi. His wife Clarice, his children, his closest advisors. Time to prepare for what came after.

"Piero," he said to his eldest son. The boy—man, at twenty—had Lorenzo's ambition but not his intelligence. Dangerous combination. "You'll inherit everything. The bank, the political influence, the alliances. Guard them carefully. They're more fragile than they look."

"I understand, Father."

"No, you don't. But you will." Lorenzo's breath came hard. The arthritis that had plagued him for years had spread, become systemic, turned his own body into a prison. "Listen carefully. Florence doesn't love the Medici. It tolerates us because we're useful. The moment you become a burden rather than an asset, they'll tear you down. So be useful. Always. Every decision, every action, ask yourself: does this serve Florence? If it doesn't, don't do it."

"And our enemies?"

"We have no permanent enemies. Only temporary obstacles. Venice, Milan, Rome—they're all potential allies or adversaries depending on circumstances. Stay flexible. Trust no one completely. And remember that in Italy, today's friend is tomorrow's betrayer."

He could see Piero not listening, not really absorbing the lesson. The boy thought power was something you inherited and kept. He didn't understand that it was something you earned daily, that you had to fight for every sunrise.

"Your younger brothers," Lorenzo continued. "Giovanni will be a cardinal. Use that. Medici influence in Rome will be crucial. And Giuliano..." He paused, thinking of his own brother, dead fourteen years now. "Giuliano is clever. Let him help you. Don't make him compete with you."

"Yes, Father."

Poliziano entered, his face wet with tears. The poet who'd been Lorenzo's companion through decades of triumph and disaster. "Should I fetch the priest?" he asked quietly.

"Not yet. I'm not quite finished." Lorenzo turned back to Piero. "One more thing. Ludovico Sforza in Milan. He's dangerous. Brilliant, ambitious, utterly without scruples. He's starting to make overtures to France, whispering to King Charles VIII about Italian opportunities. If Charles invades, if French armies come south, it will be because Ludovico thought he could control them."

"Can he?"

"No one can control France. They're too big, too powerful, too certain of their divine right to everything. If they come, Italy burns. Remember that."

The priest came then, administered last rites. Lorenzo received them with equanimity. He'd never been particularly religious—had always treated faith as another tool of statecraft—but there was comfort in ritual. In the familiar words that men had spoken for centuries at the threshold of death.

He died on April 8, 1492, as spring returned to Tuscany. Died with his family around him, in the villa where his grandfather Cosimo had built the Medici legacy. Died having survived assassination, war, papal fury, and his own body's betrayal.

Florence mourned. Not because they'd loved him—love was never the currency of power—but because they understood that something essential had ended. Lorenzo de' Medici had been Il Magnifico, the center around which Florentine politics orbited. With him gone, the system he'd maintained through sheer will and intelligence began to fracture.

"What happens now?" Piero asked Poliziano at the funeral.

"Now?" The poet looked at Lorenzo's casket, at the end of an era made physical. "Now we find out if your father built something that can survive without him. Or if the Medici die with Lorenzo."

The answer would come sooner than anyone expected.

**Rome, August 1492**

Rodrigo Borgia bought the papacy for 100,000 ducats and the promise of various benefices to key cardinals. It was the most expensive purchase he'd ever made, and the best investment.

"Holy Father," his son Cesare said, kneeling before him. The title still felt strange. Rodrigo Borgia was now Pope Alexander VI, Vicar of Christ, spiritual leader of Christendom. Also a father of multiple illegitimate children, a shameless nepotist, and a man whose appetites had scandalized Rome for decades.

He would be a magnificent disaster of a Pope.

"Rise, my son," Alexander said. "We have work to do. Italy is unstable. Lorenzo de' Medici is dead. Milan is vulnerable. France is watching. This is our moment to reshape the peninsula into something more... accommodating to our interests."

Cesare stood. He was seventeen, brilliant, ruthless, and completely amoral. Exactly the tool his father needed. "What do you want me to do?"

"For now? Study. Learn. Become a cardinal, though you hate the Church. Master warfare, though you're meant for priesthood. Because the time is coming when the Borgia will need a sword, and you'll be that weapon."

"And if I don't want to be a cardinal?"

"Then you'll be a duke. One way or another, Cesare, you'll have power. That's what Borgias do. We seize power and we hold it until death pries it from our fingers."

Alexander looked out over Rome from the papal apartments. The city that had been the center of the world, that had fallen and risen and fallen again. Under his rule, it would rise once more. The Borgia would make it great.

And if that greatness came at the cost of Italian stability, of moral authority, of every principle the Church supposedly stood for? Well. That was a price Alexander VI was perfectly willing to pay.

The old order was dying. Lorenzo de' Medici in his tomb. The generation that had fought the Pazzi Conspiracy and the Ferrara War aging and weakening. New players were taking the stage—Cesare Borgia, Charles VIII of France, younger Sforzas and Medicis who didn't remember how hard their fathers had fought to build and maintain power.

Italy stood at a precipice.

And no one realized how close they were to falling.

**Milan, December 1492**

Ludovico held Beatrice as she died, childbirth claiming her at twenty-one. She'd been his partner, his love, his anchor. And now she was gone, taking with her the last restraints on his ambition.

"Don't let it make you reckless," she whispered with her last breath. "Don't become what you fought against."

But he would. He already knew he would. Because without Beatrice, without her wisdom and caution and love, Ludovico Sforza was just ambition in human form. And ambition unchecked was the most dangerous force in Italy.

He buried her with honors, grieved publicly, and returned to plotting. France was still coming. Charles VIII was still dreaming of Italian conquest. And Ludovico was still convinced he could manipulate it all.

He was wrong.

But he wouldn't realize that until it was far too late.
