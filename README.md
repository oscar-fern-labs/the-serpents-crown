# The Serpent's Crown
## A Novel of the Italian Renaissance

A historical fiction novel chronicling the intrigue, conquest, and cultural flowering of Renaissance Italy from 1476 to 1503.

### Synopsis

In the shadow of cathedrals and the glitter of gold, Italy's greatest families vie for power in an age of assassins and artists. When Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza is murdered during Christmas Mass in 1476, it sets off a cascade of conspiracies, wars, and betrayals that will reshape the Italian peninsula.

**THE SERPENT'S CROWN** follows the intertwined fates of:

- **Ludovico Sforza** - The brilliant regent of Milan who seizes power through cunning, only to invite catastrophe
- **Lorenzo de' Medici** - Florence's "Magnificent" banker-prince who survives assassination but cannot escape mortality  
- **Caterina Sforza** - The fierce warrior-woman who refuses to be merely a pawn
- **The Borgia** - A papal family whose ambition knows no bounds
- **Venice** - The Serene Republic whose hunger for territory threatens all

From the blood-soaked marble of the Pazzi Conspiracy to the diplomatic triumph in Naples, from the War of Ferrara to the French invasion that ends Italian independence, this is the story of how brilliance without unity becomes prelude to conquest.

### Author's Note

This novel dramatizes real historical events and figures. While dialogue and internal thoughts are invented, the major events, dates, and outcomes are historically accurate. The Pazzi Conspiracy, Lorenzo's journey to Naples, the French invasion—all happened as depicted. 

Some liberties have been taken with minor details and chronology for narrative flow, but the essential truth of Renaissance Italy—brilliant, beautiful, and ultimately conquered by its own inability to unite—is preserved.
