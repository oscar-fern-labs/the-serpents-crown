### CHAPTER TWO: THE GOLDEN CITY

**Florence, April 1478**
**Fifteen Months Later**

Lorenzo de' Medici stood in the Palazzo Medici's private garden and watched his brother seduce a banker's daughter. Giuliano had always been the beautiful one, the charming one, the one who could make women forget their virtue with nothing more than a smile and a well-turned phrase. Lorenzo had been forced to develop other talents—intelligence, political acumen, the ability to balance a dozen competing interests while making each party believe they had won.

"You're glowering," said Angelo Poliziano, coming up beside him with a cup of wine in each hand. The poet-philosopher offered one to Lorenzo, who took it gratefully. "It makes you look like a gargoyle contemplating the mathematics of sin."

"I'm contemplating the mathematics of my brother's romantic entanglements," Lorenzo replied. "Do you know who she is?"

"Marietta Pazzi. Second cousin to Francesco de' Pazzi, if I'm not mistaken. And you're never mistaken about things like that, so she must be exactly who I think she is."

"Which makes this monumentally stupid," Lorenzo said, taking a long drink. The wine was excellent—Chianti from their own vineyards in the hills. Everything in Florence was excellent these days. It was enough to make a cautious man nervous.

The garden was in full spring bloom, roses and jasmine filling the air with perfume, a fountain splashing musically in the center of the courtyard. It was the kind of perfect afternoon that poets wrote odes about, the kind of moment that seemed suspended in amber, golden and unchanging. Lorenzo had learned long ago not to trust such moments. They were usually the prelude to disaster.

"The Pazzi hate us," Lorenzo said quietly, watching Giuliano lean close to whisper something that made the girl laugh. "They've hated us for two generations. They think we've stolen their rightful place in Florence, that we've used banking and political manipulation to put ourselves above our betters."

"Aren't they right?" Poliziano asked mildly.

"Of course they're right. But that doesn't mean they get to do anything about it." Lorenzo turned away from the courtyard, gesturing for Poliziano to follow him into the shaded loggia. Here, at least, they could speak without being overheard. "Francesco de' Pazzi is in Rome right now, meeting with Pope Sixtus. Do you know what they're discussing?"

"I can guess. The Pazzi Bank wants to replace the Medici Bank as the Pope's primary financial agent. They're offering better terms, faster transfers, more...flexible...accounting."

"More bribes, you mean. More willingness to look the other way when His Holiness needs funds for his nephews." Lorenzo set down his wine cup with careful precision. "The Pope already hates us. We opposed his appointment of Francesco Salviati as Archbishop of Pisa. We refused to help finance his war against Ferrara. And now the Pazzi are offering him everything he wants—money, support, and the satisfaction of humbling the Medici."

"You think Sixtus will move against us?"

"I think Sixtus already has. I have reports from Rome, from our agents in the Papal court. There are meetings, whispers, plans being made. The Pope's nephew, Girolamo Riario, has been spending time with Francesco de' Pazzi. They're not discussing banking, Angelo."

Poliziano's expression turned serious. The poet might write verses about love and beauty, but he understood power as well as any of them. "What do you want me to do?"

"Watch. Listen. And keep Giuliano alive, because God knows he won't do it himself." Lorenzo glanced back toward the courtyard, where his brother was now leading Marietta Pazzi toward a more secluded corner. "He thinks the world is all poetry and passion. He doesn't see the knives being sharpened in the dark."

"And you see too many knives," Poliziano said gently. "Sometimes, Lorenzo, a beautiful day is just a beautiful day."

"Not in Florence. Not for the Medici."

---

That night, Lorenzo summoned his inner circle to the palazzo's private chambers. They came quietly, through side doors and servants' entrances, men who had learned long ago that the most important meetings in Florence happened in shadows rather than sunlight.

Luigi Pulci arrived first, the poet-diplomat whose verses could make women swoon and whose mind could calculate interest rates faster than a Venetian banker. Francesco Nori came next, trusted friend and manager of the Medici Bank's Florentine operations. Then Tommaso Soderini, whose family had been allied with the Medici for three generations. Finally, Giuliano himself wandered in, still flushed from his afternoon's entertainment, smelling of perfume and wine.

"Brother," Lorenzo said quietly. "Sit."

Something in his tone made Giuliano's smile fade. He took a chair, suddenly attentive. "What's happened?"

"Nothing yet. But something will." Lorenzo moved to the table where a map of Italy lay spread, weighed down at the corners with silver candlesticks. "Gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads. To the north, Milan is still recovering from Duke Galeazzo's assassination. Ludovico Sforza holds power as regent, but his position is not yet secure. To the south, King Ferrante of Naples watches and waits, that old spider always ready to expand his web. To the east, Venice grows stronger every day, swallowing up territories on the mainland like a serpent consuming eggs."

"And Rome?" Soderini asked.

"Rome," Lorenzo said, "wants us destroyed."

The words hung in the air like smoke. Giuliano leaned forward. "That's a strong accusation, Lorenzo."

"It's the truth. Pope Sixtus has never forgiven us for opposing his wars, his appointments, his nepotism. And now the Pazzi family is offering him an opportunity to strike at the Medici while enriching themselves in the process."

Francesco Nori cleared his throat. "My lord, if you're suggesting what I think you're suggesting—a conspiracy, here in Florence—then we need evidence. We need to act."

"We need to be careful," Lorenzo corrected. "The Pazzi are Florentine nobility. They have allies, supporters, connections throughout the city. If we move against them without proof, we'll look like tyrants. And Florence has never loved tyrants."

"Florence loves winners," Pulci said quietly. "The question is whether we can win this game before it turns deadly."

Giuliano stood abruptly, pacing to the window. "This is insane. We're talking about murder, about conspiracy in the heart of Florence. This isn't Rome or Milan. We don't assassinate each other in churches."

"Don't we?" Lorenzo's voice was soft but cutting. "Brother, you were five years old when Cosimo returned from exile and purged his enemies. You don't remember the bodies, the accusations, the men who disappeared in the night. But I do. I remember our grandfather explaining that power in Florence is a game with only one rule: survive. Everything else is negotiable."

"Cosimo de' Medici was—"

"A banker who became a prince in all but name," Lorenzo interrupted. "He did what was necessary to preserve our family and our city. And now we must do the same."

He moved around the table, placing his hands flat on the map. "Here's what I know: Francesco de' Pazzi is in Rome, meeting with Pope Sixtus and Girolamo Riario. Archbishop Salviati has been seen in the same circles, despite having no business there. A condottiero named Montesecco has been hired, though nominally he's in the Pope's service. And there are whispers—vague, unconfirmed, but persistent—of something being planned for Florence."

"What kind of something?" Nori asked.

"The kind that ends with new management at the Medici Bank and new leadership for Florence." Lorenzo straightened. "Gentlemen, I believe the Pazzi intend to move against us. Soon. Possibly during some public event where we'll be vulnerable, where they can claim afterward that they acted to free Florence from tyranny."

"Do we have allies?" Soderini asked. "Can we count on Milan?"

"Ludovico Sforza has his own problems. He's still consolidating power, still fending off challenges to his regency. He'll offer words of support but little actual help." Lorenzo shook his head. "No, we're alone in this. Which means we must be smarter, faster, more ruthless than our enemies."

"What do you need from us?" Pulci asked.

"Eyes and ears. I want to know every move the Pazzi make. Who they meet with, where they go, what they say in supposedly private conversations. I want to know which families in Florence support them and which can be swayed to our side. And I want it all done quietly, carefully, so that if we're wrong—if this is all paranoia and shadows—we haven't committed ourselves to a war we don't need to fight."

"And if you're right?" Giuliano asked quietly. "If they really are planning to kill us?"

Lorenzo met his brother's eyes. "Then we make sure they fail. And we make sure that everyone in Italy understands what happens to those who strike at the Medici."

The meeting broke up shortly after, each man departing as quietly as he'd arrived. Only Giuliano remained, standing by the window, looking out over Florence's nighttime streets.

"You're scared," he said finally.

"Terrified," Lorenzo admitted. "But fear can be useful, if you channel it properly. It keeps you sharp, keeps you from making stupid mistakes."

"Like falling in love with a Pazzi girl?"

Lorenzo smiled despite himself. "Like that, yes."

Giuliano turned to face him. "I'm not a fool, Lorenzo. I know Marietta is probably being used, that her family hopes to gain some advantage through her. But sometimes...sometimes can't we just enjoy life? Must everything be calculation and strategy?"

"No," Lorenzo said. "Not everything. But more things than you'd like. That's the price we pay for power, brother. We don't get to be just men. We have to be symbols, chess pieces, players in a game that never ends."

"I hate this," Giuliano said quietly.

"I know. But hating it doesn't make it less real."

They stood in silence for a long moment, two brothers separated by temperament but bound by blood and fate. Finally, Giuliano moved to the door.

"Be careful," Lorenzo said. "Please. I've already lost too much to this cursed game. I won't lose you too."

Giuliano nodded, but said nothing. Then he was gone, leaving Lorenzo alone with his maps and his fears and his certainty that something terrible was coming to Florence.

---

Three days later, Lorenzo received word that Francesco de' Pazzi had returned from Rome. The banker came back to Florence with a new swagger in his step and a smile that didn't reach his eyes. He attended Mass at the Duomo, dined with other noble families, and made a point of being seen throughout the city.

And he never once tried to speak with Lorenzo or Giuliano.

That, more than anything else, confirmed Lorenzo's suspicions. Francesco de' Pazzi was not a subtle man. If he'd truly been pursuing legitimate banking business in Rome, he would have crowed about it, would have found ways to remind the Medici that the Pazzi were their equals. Instead, he was quiet. Watchful. Waiting.

Lorenzo doubled the guards around the Palazzo Medici. He moved important documents to secure locations. He sent messages to their agents throughout Italy, warning them to be prepared for disruption. And he prayed—not to God, who seemed to favor popes and conspirators more than bankers who tried to do right—but to Fortune, that fickle goddess who could raise up or cast down with equal caprice.

The spring days passed in golden succession. Florence bloomed. Artists worked on commissions funded by Medici gold. Scholars debated philosophy in Medici-sponsored academies. The city prospered, unaware that beneath its beauty, men were sharpening knives and choosing their moment.

Lorenzo felt time slipping away like sand through his fingers. Every conversation might be his last. Every sunrise might be the final one he'd see. He'd never been a religious man—banking and piety mixed poorly—but now he found himself bargaining with God in the quiet hours before dawn.

Let me protect my family. Let me see my children grow. Let me save Florence from the chaos that will come if the Pazzi succeed.

He asked for so little, really. Just survival. Just one more day, and then another, until his enemies made their move and he could finally respond.

The waiting was the worst part. Knowing something would happen but not when, not where. Living each day in a state of heightened alert, seeing conspiracy in every shadow, threats in every smile.

"You need sleep," his wife Clarice told him one night, finding him at his desk long past midnight, surrounded by letters and reports. "You're going to make yourself sick."

"I can't," Lorenzo said simply. "Not yet."

"The Pazzi?"

He nodded. Clarice was Roman nobility, an Orsini, and she understood the games that powerful families played. She'd been fifteen when they married, chosen more for her political connections than for love. But over the years, something deeper had grown between them—not passion like Giuliano's romances, but partnership. Understanding. Trust.

"When?" she asked.

"Soon. They're waiting for the right moment. A public event, probably. Somewhere I can't easily be guarded, where they can claim afterward that they acted for Florence's good."

"And you'll be ready?"

Lorenzo thought about that. About Francesco Nori's loyalty and Poliziano's intelligence and Giuliano's reckless courage. About the guards he'd stationed around the palazzo and the allies he'd cultivated throughout the city. About everything he'd built over years of careful planning.

"I hope so," he said. "God help me, I hope so."

Clarice came around the desk and kissed the top of his head, a gesture of affection that caught him by surprise. "You're a good man, Lorenzo. Better than Florence deserves. Whatever happens, remember that."

"I'm not a good man," he replied. "I'm a survivor. There's a difference."

"Perhaps," she said. "But I'll love you regardless."

After she left, Lorenzo sat in the darkness and wondered if love would be enough. If anything would be enough, when the knives came out and the blood started to flow.

Outside, Florence slept. The golden city, jewel of Tuscany, heart of the Renaissance. Beautiful and terrible and utterly indifferent to the struggles of men who thought they could control it.

Lorenzo de' Medici poured himself more wine and returned to his correspondence, reading reports by candlelight, searching for the pattern that would tell him where and when the blow would fall.

He didn't have long to wait.

The trap was already closing.
