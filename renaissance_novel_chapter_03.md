### CHAPTER THREE: THE RISING TIDE

**Venice, April 1478**

Doge Giovanni Mocenigo stood on the balcony of the Doge's Palace and watched the sea. From here, he could see the lagoon stretching toward the horizon, dotted with merchant vessels returning from Constantinople, from Alexandria, from ports whose names most Italians had never heard. Each ship represented wealth, power, the commercial dominance that had made Venice the richest city in Christendom.

But wealth alone was not enough. Not anymore.

"The reports from Milan," his secretary said quietly, approaching with a leather folder. "As you requested, Serenity."

Mocenigo took the documents without turning from the view. "Summarize."

"Ludovico Sforza has consolidated his position as regent. Duchess Bona has been sidelined, her supporters either bought off or intimidated. Young Duke Gian Galeazzo is a puppet. For all practical purposes, Ludovico is Milan."

"And Florence?"

"Tensions rising. The Pazzi family is making moves against the Medici. Our agents report meetings in Rome, conversations with Pope Sixtus. Something is brewing."

"Good," Mocenigo said softly. "Let them tear each other apart. While Milan and Florence bleed, Venice expands."

He turned finally to look at his secretary, a young man named Marco Dandolo, brilliant and ambitious and completely loyal to the Republic. "What progress on the mainland?"

"The Council of Ten has approved military action in the Romagna. We're positioning condottieri along the border. If Forlì's defenses weaken, if Imola becomes available, we'll be ready to move." Dandolo paused. "But it depends on Milan staying distracted, and Florence staying weak."

"Which is why the Pazzi conspiracy serves us perfectly," Mocenigo said. "Whether they succeed or fail, Florence will be destabilized. The Medici will either be dead or fighting for survival. Either way, they won't be able to oppose our expansion." He moved to the ornate desk that dominated the chamber, spreading out a map of northern Italy. "Here. And here. These are the territories we'll take first. Small cities, technically independent but practically defenseless. We'll offer protection, favorable trade terms, the safety of Venetian law. They'll welcome us."

"And if they don't?"

"Then we'll take them anyway. But we'll be merciful about it." Mocenigo traced a finger along the map, from Venice westward toward Milan, southward toward Florence. "The age of the condottieri is ending, Marco. Do you know why?"

"Tell me, Serenity."

"Because mercenaries fight for gold, not glory. They maneuver, they avoid pitched battles, they preserve their forces because their forces are their capital. But Venice doesn't rely on mercenaries alone. We have citizen soldiers, arsenalotti from the shipyards, men who fight because they're fighting for their homes." He looked up at Dandolo. "When we move into the mainland, we won't be raiding. We'll be conquering. And we won't stop until Venice controls everything from the Alps to the Apennines."

"A bold vision, Serenity."

"A necessary one. Look at the map, Marco. What do you see?"

Dandolo studied the parchment. "I see... fragmentation. Dozens of small states, each competing with the others. Milan, Florence, Genoa, the Papal States. Ferrara, Mantua, Urbino. All fighting over scraps."

"Exactly. And what happens when France or Spain or the Holy Roman Empire decides to stop watching this comedy and start participating?" Mocenigo's voice was hard. "We'll be crushed. Individually, these Italian states are wealthy but weak. United, we might stand a chance. But we'll never unite—not willingly. So Venice must become strong enough to stand alone."

"You're talking about war with the other Italian powers."

"I'm talking about survival. Florence is distracted by the Medici-Pazzi feud. Milan is recovering from Galeazzo's assassination. Rome is mired in papal politics. This is our moment, Marco. If we don't seize it, someone else will."

A knock at the door interrupted them. One of the Council of Ten entered, his expression grave. "Serenity, we have word from our agent in Florence. The Pazzi are moving. Within days, possibly hours."

Mocenigo felt a surge of satisfaction. "Details?"

"They plan to strike during High Mass at the Duomo. Both Lorenzo and Giuliano will be present. Archbishop Salviati will move to seize the Palazzo della Signoria simultaneously. If they succeed, Florence falls into chaos. If they fail..." The councilor shrugged. "Well, the aftermath will be equally destabilizing."

"Perfect," Mocenigo said. "Send word to our condottieri in the Romagna. Prepare to move on Ferrara's outlying territories. And make sure our ambassador in Florence is positioned to offer aid to whichever side emerges victorious—for a price."

"Yes, Serenity."

After the councilor departed, Dandolo turned to the Doge. "You seem pleased."

"I am. Italy is about to tear itself apart, and Venice will profit from every wound." He rolled up the map carefully. "Remember this lesson, Marco: true power isn't about winning battles. It's about positioning yourself so that you win regardless of the outcome. The Pazzi succeed? Florence becomes weak and divided, easy to manipulate. The Medici survive? They'll be damaged, desperate for allies, willing to make concessions. Either way, Venice comes out stronger."

"And Milan?"

"Ludovico Sforza is clever, but he's playing defense. Everything he does is about maintaining his regency, about keeping young Gian Galeazzo on the throne while exercising real power himself. He has no time for expansion, no resources for foreign adventures. Which means the mainland territories between Venice and Milan are there for the taking."

Mocenigo moved to a cabinet and withdrew a crystal decanter of wine. He poured two glasses—Cypriot vintage, sweet and dark as blood. "To Venice," he said, raising his glass. "And to the foolishness of our neighbors."

"To Venice," Dandolo echoed.

They drank, and outside the window, the lagoon glittered in the afternoon sun.

**Milan, Same Day**

Ludovico Sforza read the letter from Florence three times before allowing himself to react. Then he permitted himself a single, quiet curse.

"Problems, my lord?" Cicco Simonetta asked from across the council chamber.

"Lorenzo de' Medici writes to warn me of a conspiracy. The Pazzi family, backed by Pope Sixtus, plans to move against the Medici. He asks for our support, for public statements of solidarity, for the threat of military action if Florence is attacked."

"And you're troubled because...?"

"Because if I support the Medici too openly, I antagonize the Pope. And I can't afford to fight Rome right now—not while my position here is still being challenged." Ludovico set down the letter. "But if I abandon the Medici, I break our families' traditional alliance. And I'll need Florence's support when Venice eventually turns its attention to Milan."

"Politics," Simonetta said dryly. "Always more complicated than murder."

Ludovico laughed despite himself. "Quite. What do you recommend?"

"Write back expressing sympathy and concern. Offer to mediate if conflict breaks out. Promise support in principle while committing nothing specific. The usual diplomatic dance."

"And if the Pazzi succeed? If Lorenzo and Giuliano both die?"

"Then Florence falls into chaos, and we position ourselves as the voice of stability. We offer to help restore order—for appropriate considerations, of course. Territorial adjustments, trade concessions, that sort of thing."

"You're a cold man, Cicco."

"I serve Milan's interests, my lord. Not Florence's, not the Medici's. Milan's." The minister leaned forward. "With respect, you've been too focused on internal matters. Young Duke Gian Galeazzo is secure on his throne, Duchess Bona is neutralized, and your own position is unassailable. It's time to look outward. To remember that Milan is not just a city but a duchy, and a duchy must expand or die."

"Expand where? Venice blocks us to the east. The Swiss block us to the north. Florence is our ally to the south. And Genoa..." Ludovico shook his head. "Genoa is too unstable to be worth the effort."

"Then we look to the smaller states. Ferrara, Mantua, the little lordships of the Romagna. We marry into them, we manipulate their politics, we make them dependent on Milanese support. And when the time comes, we absorb them." Simonetta stood, moving to the same kind of map that hung in every Italian ruler's chamber. "Your father understood this, my lord. Francesco Sforza didn't just take Milan—he made it into a power that could stand against Venice and Florence and Rome. Under Duke Galeazzo, we stagnated. But under you..."

"Under me, we do the same thing," Ludovico said flatly. "I maintain the status quo. I keep the duchy running. I don't lose ground. But I don't gain any either."

"Exactly. And that concerns me."

Ludovico studied his minister. Simonetta had served his father faithfully, had managed the transition to Galeazzo's rule despite despising the man, and now advised Ludovico with the same cold pragmatism. He was invaluable. He was also dangerous—too smart, too capable, too willing to speak uncomfortable truths.

"What would you have me do?" Ludovico asked.

"Be ambitious. You've secured your position here. Now use it. Young Gian Galeazzo needs a bride—arrange a marriage that brings us alliances and territory. Your niece Caterina should be married off to some condottiero who can serve our interests. And you yourself, my lord, should consider taking a wife. An advantageous one."

Ludovico felt something tighten in his chest. He'd avoided marriage, avoided the complications of a duchess who might have her own ambitions, her own family's interests. But Simonetta was right—a strategic marriage could double Milan's power overnight.

"Who did you have in mind?" he asked carefully.

"Beatrice d'Este. Daughter of Duke Ercole of Ferrara. She's young, beautiful, intelligent. And a marriage alliance with Ferrara would give us a buffer against Venice, access to the Po River valley, and a connection to the Este family's extensive network."

"She's also fifteen years old."

"Sixteen in a few months. Old enough for marriage by any standard. And the match would be mutually beneficial—Ferrara needs Milan's protection against Venice, and we need Ferrara's strategic position." Simonetta's expression was calculating. "More importantly, my lord, it would signal to Italy that you're not merely a regent keeping the seat warm for young Gian Galeazzo. You'd be establishing your own dynasty, your own line. Future historians would speak of Ludovico Sforza as a founder, not a caretaker."

The idea had its attractions. Ludovico had always been the younger son, the one not expected to rule. He'd made himself indispensable through cunning and patience, but he'd never thought of himself as building something permanent. A dynasty. A legacy.

"I'll consider it," he said finally. "But first, we need to survive the immediate crisis. If Florence falls into civil war, if the Pazzi succeed in killing the Medici, the entire balance of power in Italy shifts. Venice will move. Rome will move. And we need to be ready to respond."

"Agreed. What do you want me to prepare?"

"Letters to our condottieri. Make sure they're ready to mobilize on short notice. Messages to our agents in Venice, Rome, Florence—I want to know what's happening before it happens. And draft a response to Lorenzo de' Medici that sounds supportive while committing us to nothing."

"Consider it done, my lord."

After Simonetta departed, Ludovico remained at his desk, thinking about everything that was in motion. Florence on the brink of conspiracy. Venice expanding. His own position secure but static. The letter from Lorenzo lay before him, a plea for help from a man who understood that power in Italy was slipping away from the traditional players.

Ludovico had spent fifteen months consolidating control of Milan. He'd outmaneuvered Duchess Bona, co-opted the city's nobility, made himself essential to every aspect of governance. He was regent in name but ruler in fact. And yet...

And yet he was still reacting to events rather than creating them. Still responding to other people's moves rather than making his own. It was time to change that.

He pulled out fresh parchment and began to write. Not to Lorenzo—that could wait. This letter was to Ercole d'Este in Ferrara. A casual inquiry. An expression of interest. The first move in a game that might reshape northern Italy.

Marriage to Beatrice d'Este. An alliance with Ferrara. A signal to Venice that Milan would not be pushed. A warning to Florence that their ally was looking to his own interests now.

The pen scratched across the paper, and Ludovico felt the familiar thrill of beginning something new. Something dangerous. Something that might either establish his legacy or destroy everything he'd built.

Outside, the spring evening gathered over Milan. The city that had been his prison was becoming his kingdom. And kingdoms, Ludovico was learning, were built on more than just survival. They required vision. Ambition. The willingness to seize moments when they came.

The Pazzi conspiracy in Florence might destroy the Medici, or it might fail. Either way, Italy was about to change. And Ludovico Sforza intended to be on the winning side—whichever side that turned out to be.

He finished the letter, sealed it, and called for a courier. Fast horses to Ferrara. A proposal of marriage that was also a proposal of alliance. The beginning of something that would either make Milan great again or set the entire peninsula aflame.

Ludovico smiled to himself. Finally, after all these months of defensive maneuvering, he was playing offense again. And it felt good.

The game continued. The players positioned themselves. And in Florence, Lorenzo de' Medici waited for the blow to fall, unaware that his call for help would go unanswered.

He was on his own.

They all were.

In the beautiful, bloody, backstabbing world of Renaissance Italy, alliance was always temporary, loyalty was always conditional, and survival was the only victory that mattered.

The spring of 1478 would be remembered. But not for its poetry or its art or its philosophy.

It would be remembered for blood.
